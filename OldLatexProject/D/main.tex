Farmer John had $N$ cows numbered $0$ to $N-1$. One day he saw $K$ cows running away from his farm. Fox Brus computed the sum of the numbers of the escaped cows. She only told John that the sum was divisible by $N$. 

Your task is to help John by counting the number of possible sets of escaped cows. This number may be very big, so printindex it modulo $1,000,000,007$. $N$ will be between 1 and 1,000, inclusive. $K$ will be between 1 and 47, inclusive. $K$ will be less than or equal to $N$. For the first sample: 7 cows are numbered 0 to 6 and 4 of them run away. Possible sets of escaped cows are $\{0, 1, 2, 4\}$, $\{0, 3, 5, 6\}$, $\{1, 2, 5, 6\}$, $\{1, 3, 4, 6\}$, $\{2, 3, 4, 5\}$.

\subsection* {Input}

The input will contain several test case, each in a line. The integers $N$ and $K$

\subsection* {Output}

Print a line per test case, the solution to the problem.
